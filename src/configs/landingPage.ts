        cooking â€” it's something that's been a part of me for as long as I can
        remember. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working in many
        different restaurants, learning the ins and outs of the kitchen and
        fine-tuning my craft. But through it all, one dream has always stuck
        with me: opening my own food truck. Now, that dream is a reality, and
        I'm bringing the best of Maine's coastal cuisine straight to Florida.
        From lobster rolls to blueberry pie, I'm excited to share the flavors I
        grew up with and bring a little taste of Downeast Maine to the Sunshine
        State.
